# todo-react

## Learning Objectives

    - be able to create a new React application
    - be able to "think in React"
    - be able to use basic hooks for managing state and reactivity
    - be able to organize your app in components
  
## Mission

This time the task is simple: you will build a small Todo application that lives in your browser, and saves todos even after restarting the browser.
